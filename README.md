# PrisonersDilemma
Trying to find out what is the best strategy for a repeated prisoner's dilemma.

Feel free to add your own strategies. to do that just add a class to the strats package and implement the Strat interface, the function betray gets the prisoners and the "enemy" prisoner turns, you also have access to the amount of rounds and money earnings from the Globals class.
